## What Fabric is

Wails desktop app that generates Wati-grounded UI from natural-language prompts. Built for designers and PMs (non-developers). Chat interface paired with a live preview pane. Backed by Claude via the Anthropic SDK.

**Strategic positioning:** Fabric is one consumer surface for the *rules layer* (markdown files defining Wati's design system constraints). Cursor and other AI coding tools can consume the same rules. The rules are the IP. Fabric is the delivery vehicle for non-developers.

---

## Stack

- **Desktop framework:** Wails v2 (Go backend + React frontend)
- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **AI SDK:** `@anthropic-ai/sdk` v0.95.1
- **Model:** `claude-sonnet-4-6` primary, `claude-opus-4-7` fallback
- **Storage:** User config directory (cross-platform — `~/Library/Application Support/Fabric/` on Mac, `%APPDATA%\Fabric\` on Windows)

## Architecture: the rules layer

Fabric's core innovation is the rules layer — markdown files that constrain what the AI generates:

- **`frontend/src/rules/global.md`** — universal Wati rules (aesthetic, component vocabulary, tokens, slot patterns, hard rules)
- **`frontend/src/rules/archetypes/*.md`** — page-type specific rules (analytics today; list, detail, form, etc. to come)

These are imported via Vite `?raw` syntax in `systemPrompt.ts` (lines 4-5) and injected into the system prompt after `OUTPUT_DISCIPLINE_RULES`, before WATI API context (lines 511-521). Injection markers use `##` heading style to match other rule blocks.

**Critical: rules files are bundled at build time.** Editing rules requires a Vite rebuild to take effect. No hot-reload — rules are inlined into the JS bundle.

---

## Slot pattern (MANDATORY)

Generated UI must use slot placeholders, not real assets:

- `<IconSlot>` — icon placeholders (no real Lucide/MUI icons in output)
- `<ChartSlot>` — chart visualization placeholders
- `<DataSlot>` — dynamic data values
- `<MetricSlot>` — KPI numbers
- `<DeltaBadgeSlot>` — trend deltas
- `<TimestampSlot>` — time/date displays
- `<CopySlot>` — copy/text content

The slot pattern prevents the AI from making aesthetic decisions (which icon? what specific number?). Real assets get bound at handoff time by engineers.

---

## Prompt caching

**Enabled by default** via `PROMPT_CACHING_ENABLED = true` in `systemPrompt.ts`. Full system prompt (~47K tokens) is sent as a single `TextBlockParam` with `cache_control: { type: "ephemeral" }`.

Cost (Sonnet 4 pricing):
- First turn: ~$0.32 (cache write)
- Subsequent turns: ~$0.13 (cache read at 90% discount)
- Savings: ~$0.19 per turn after the first

Pricing constants live in `App.tsx`:
- `PRICE_INPUT_PER_M = 3.00`
- `PRICE_OUTPUT_PER_M = 15.00`
- `PRICE_CACHE_WRITE_PER_M = 3.75`
- `PRICE_CACHE_READ_PER_M = 0.30`

Token usage captured via `await stream.finalMessage()` in both primary and fallback paths, stored on `Message.usage?: Usage`, displayed inline using `fmtDollars()` helper.

Cost copy format (verified working):
- First turn: `"Cost ~$0.32 · cache built (next turn will be ~$0.13)"`
- Subsequent: `"Cost ~$0.13 · without caching: ~$0.32 · saved ~$0.19"`

## Wati design system context (what Fabric generates against)

- **Brand primary:** `#23a455` (`--wati-color-green-500`)
- **Brand accent:** `#00e785` (`--wati-color-brand-green-dark`)
- **Canonical Harmony:** `packages/ui/Materials/*` in the Wati FE repo (NOT in Fabric)
- **Tokens:** `packages/shared/styles/designTokens.css` (Figma-synced — code changes may not survive sync)
- **Legacy ratio:** `StandardButton` (456 imports) vs Harmony `Materials/Button` (55 imports). 8:1 legacy. Fabric pulls codebase toward Harmony.

### Wati FE constraints worth knowing

- `designTokens.css` is **Figma-synced**. Token value changes happen in Figma, not code.
- **Triple bookkeeping:** Tailwind config + `Colors.defaultTheme` (styled.ts) + CSS variables. Three sources of truth for the same concepts.
- Harmony components have **no `@media` queries** — fixed-size primitives, mobile responsiveness happens at page level via dedicated mobile components (MobileContactRow pattern).
- **Anatomical dependencies:** Button heights (32/40/48), Input min-heights (44/36), Dialog padding (64px) baked into page layouts. Do not change.
- Input focus token misnamed: `--wati-border-success-default` used for generic focus.
- **Multi-library coexistence:** MUI v5, Semantic UI React, Radix primitives, react-bootstrap, react-select all coexist. Tables especially fragmented.

---

## Conventions

- **Imports:** Vite `?raw` for markdown, named imports for SDK types.
- **Streaming:** `streamChat()` accepts `string | Array<TextBlockParam>` for system prompt. Returns `onComplete(text, usage)`.
- **Error handling:** Primary model → fallback model → show error in chat with thumbs-down hint.
- **UI state:** Streaming assistant messages render `__THINKING__` marker before content, then stream tokens. `Generating…` indicator at message header during stream.
- **Toasts:** Use `showToast()` for silent failures (e.g. session-switch rejections).
- **No `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` for app state** — desktop app uses Wails file storage via Go backend.
- **App-level UI state lives in `state.json`** (Go `appState` struct, alongside `ActiveSessionID`). Examples: `SidebarCollapsed`. Add new fields with `omitempty`. `persistAppState(activeID)` reads the existing state and only mutates the active session id, so sibling fields are preserved across session changes. Per-chat UI state (selectedVersionIndex etc.) is **transient** — never persisted. **Sidebar collapse is app-level, not per-chat** — do not tie it to session state, do not reset on session switch.
- **All typography uses the canonical system-ui font stack.** No webfonts. No `font-family` declarations in generated code — the preview iframe injects font CSS at `<head>` level (`build/preview-server-template/index.html` `<style>` block + `src/index.css` `:root`) so generated code inherits automatically. Fabric chrome (`frontend/src/index.css`, Tailwind `fontFamily.sans` override) uses the same stack: `system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif` + `font-feature-settings: "cv02", "cv03", "cv04", "cv11"` for SF Pro stylistic alternates on Mac. Monospace is preserved only for `<code>`/`<pre>` blocks.
- **Generated mock data MUST come from personas, never from generic placeholders.** See `frontend/src/rules/personas.md`. No "John Doe", "Acme Corp", "user_001", or any name not in the six fixed personas. Numbers (contact counts, open rates) and string values (broadcast titles, template names) must come from the picked persona to keep the demo internally consistent.
- **Iteration history — auto-fork-on-edit semantics:** A "version" is any assistant message in `messages[]` with `tsxGenerated === true`. Selecting an older version via the preview-pane dropdown is **transient view state only** (`selectedVersionIndex` resets on session switch and on stream completion). If a user types a new prompt while viewing an older version, `messages[]` is **truncated** after that version's index before the new turn appends — later versions are discarded. The "Fork from here" action in the dropdown is the preservation path: it creates a new chat containing `messages[0..versionIndex]` and switches the user to it; the original chat is untouched. Preview swap on version select calls `WriteGeneratedCode(tsx)` (live file only, does NOT touch `cached_preview.tsx`), so on session reload the latest version is correctly restored. Future sessions: do not redesign this; the auto-fork default is intentional.
- **Multimodal messages are first-class.** User messages may contain text, images, or both. Image rendering touches ONLY the user-message branch in `messages.map` — never the assistant render branch, never `DeliverableView`. Adding new attachment types follows the same pattern: extend Go `ChatMessage` struct additively, extend frontend `Message` type, round-trip through `chatMessagesToUi` / `uiMessagesToChatPayload`, render in the user branch only. All attach handlers (paste / drop / picker) gate on `!isStreaming`.

## Anti-patterns (DO NOT)

- ❌ Generate UI with real icons (must use `IconSlot`)
- ❌ Use multi-color palettes — Wati primary green is the SINGLE accent
- ❌ Add multiple shadows / stacked elevation to cards
- ❌ Use `outline: none` on focus states without replacement focus indicator
- ❌ Change Harmony component default heights (32/40/48 Button, 44/36 Input, 64px Dialog padding)
- ❌ Edit `designTokens.css` token values directly — that's Figma's job
- ❌ Generate page layouts wider than 1200px content area (Wati admin is fixed-width)
- ❌ Import webfonts (no Inter, no Google Fonts, no `@font-face`) — typography is system-ui only across Fabric chrome AND generated previews
- ❌ Bundle real chart libraries (Recharts, Chart.js) in generated output — use `ChartSlot`

---

## Shipped

- **Iteration history UI** — version dropdown in preview-pane header (`V{n} of {total} ▾`). Hidden when ≤1 version. Click row → preview swaps via `WriteGeneratedCode`. Hover-revealed "Fork from here" creates a new chat containing the version prefix and switches to it. Auto-fork-on-edit is the default when typing while viewing an older version; warning appears above the chat input ("Typing will fork from Vn — Vm will be lost"). Auto-snaps to latest on stream complete. Per-message `created_at` field added to Go `ChatMessage` struct (additive, `omitempty`). See Conventions for the auto-fork rationale.
- **Collapsible sidebar (DeepSeek-style)** — sidebar toggles between expanded (240px) and collapsed (**44px**, tight single-column) via `PanelLeftClose`/`PanelLeftOpen` icon button. Collapsed mode renders a separate minimal layout: two stacked icon buttons (expand toggle on top, `Plus` new-chat below), each a 44×40 hit area with an 18px icon centered, ghost hover (`bg-[#EEEEEE]`). No divider, no chat list, no brand — every pixel is given back to chat+preview. Expanded mode keeps the full layout: collapse-toggle icon in the sidebar header (top-right), full-width "+ New chat" button, chat list below. Width + padding transition 200ms ease-out. State persisted via Go `appState.SidebarCollapsed`, accessed through `GetSidebarCollapsed()` / `SetSidebarCollapsed(bool)` Wails methods. Refactored Go `persistAppState` to preserve sibling fields (was previously overwriting the whole struct on every session change).
- **Sandbox Personas** — six realistic Wati customers (Priya's Saree Studio / Lagos Fashion Hub / Manila Wellness Clinic / Cairo Express Logistics / São Paulo Beauty Co / Jakarta Tech Academy) drive mock data in all generated previews. Defined in `frontend/src/rules/personas.md`, injected via `?raw` into `systemPrompt.ts` between `globalRules` and `analyticsArchetype`. The AI picks the persona whose industry/use-case best fits the prompt; default is Priya's Saree Studio. Persona contact counts, open rates, broadcast titles, and template names are fixed (consistent across regenerations).
- **Compact chat typography** — 13px body / 14px input / `lineHeight: 1.5` / `gap-1.5` between messages / sidebar shows title only with `title="Last updated: {relative time}"` tooltip on hover. CSS-only changes, no component restructuring. Inline document content (DeliverableView, PersonaCardRow, parsePrdSections, extractFirstSentence — all in App.tsx) is explicitly off-limits to typography passes: those have their own internal scale and any future density change must NOT touch them.
- **Image attachment in chat input** — users can paste, drag-drop, or file-pick up to 5 images per message (PNG / JPEG / GIF / WebP, max 10 MB each, auto-compressed to JPEG@0.85 over 2 MB). Attached images render as thumbnail chips above the textarea with an X to remove. User messages with images render the thumbnails (max 120px) above the text bubble; clicking opens an inline lightbox modal (Esc/backdrop to close). Multimodal content is built per Anthropic SDK spec (`{ type: "image", source: { type: "base64", media_type, data }}` blocks before the text block). All attach affordances (paste/drop/picker button) are gated on `!isStreaming`. Persistence extends Go `ChatMessage` with `Images []ChatMessageImage` (omitempty). Wati-ify workflow (paste a Stripe screenshot + "rebuild this in Wati") works automatically via the existing rules layer — no rule changes required.

## Pending work (highest leverage first)

1. **Download buttons for artifacts** — `.md` for docs, `.jsx` for components, `.html` for previews, `.pdf` for engineering specs. *Scope: few hours.*
2. **Library** — shared folder ("Fabric Library") stores published chats as read-only. Opening a Library chat shows it in viewer mode. Any edit/prompt auto-clones to user's local workspace as a new editable chat. Original untouched. (Note: per-chat-version auto-fork-on-edit is already shipped; this is chat-level auto-fork.) *Scope: ~1.5 days.*
3. **Markdown canvas editing** — Monaco editor or textarea + markdown preview for engineering docs. Save back to chat state. *Scope: 1–2 days.*
4. **BE integration** — separate workstream. Requires auth model audit, SecOps review, Ishwarya sponsorship. Don't start without those three locked in.
5. **Windows `.exe` build** — `wails build -platform windows/amd64`. Defer until distribution model decided.

## Tech debt

- **Image storage is base64-inline in `chat.json`** (v1, image attachment feature). Each attached image lives as a base64 string inside the chat row. A 2 MB image is ~2.7 MB of text; 5 images × N messages will bloat `chat.json` and slow session loads. Refactor when this becomes a problem: write image bytes to a per-session `attachments/` folder on disk, store `{filename, media_type}` references in `chat.json`, garbage-collect on session delete. Migration is straightforward — Go `ChatMessageImage` struct just changes from inline `Data string` to filename reference, and `chatMessagesToUi` resolves the bytes on load.

---

## Demo prompts (canonical test cases)

Used to verify Fabric still produces consistent, Wati-grounded output after any rule or prompt change. Run both after any change to `global.md`, `archetypes/*.md`, or `systemPrompt.ts`.

1. **Campaign Analytics page** — should produce a 3-column metric grid + chart area + recent activity list. All metrics use `MetricSlot`, deltas use `DeltaBadgeSlot`, icons use `IconSlot`. Wati primary green for CTAs. No shadows on cards.

2. **Broadcast Intelligence page** — should produce structurally similar layout to Campaign Analytics but with different content (broadcast-specific metrics: open rate, click rate, delivered, failed). **Structural similarity is the proof point** — rules enforce consistency, prompts vary content.

If either prompt produces wildly different structures, the rules layer is failing.

---

## Strategic context (briefly)

- **HOP sponsor:** Ishwarya Srinivas — pitched and validated.
- **Engineering manager:** validated, granted access to Wati BE + FE repos.
- **Senior PMs:** validated, demanding broader access.
- **Distribution model:** TBD. Desktop (.exe + Mac app) is the stopgap; hosted web app is the likely future direction.

## Self-update protocol

This file doesn't literally self-update. It updates because you (or Claude Code, prompted by you) keeps it current.

**At the end of any session that:**
- Changes architecture, conventions, or anti-patterns
- Adds new files or moves existing files
- Completes pending work items (move from Pending → done, remove from list)
- Adds new pending work
- Changes strategic context

**…run this prompt in Claude Code:**

> *"Update CLAUDE.md to reflect what we did in this session. Keep it concise. Prune stale pending work. Don't let the file balloon past ~400 lines."*

That's the entire workflow. The discipline of running that prompt is what makes this file useful long-term. Without it, context drifts.

### Optional: weekly sync

Once a week, run:

> *"Read CLAUDE.md. Tell me what's stale, what's missing, and what should be pruned. Don't change anything yet — just propose edits."*

Then review the proposal, decide, and run the update.

---

**Last updated:** Initial creation — capture current state of Fabric after rules layer integration, prompt caching, iteration history work pending, Library + auto-fork-on-edit pending, BE integration deferred to separate workstream.
